Revision history for Perl extension Moose

0.02 
    * Moose
        - many more tests, fixing some bugs/edge 
          and cases, general development work
        - &extends now loads the base module with
          UNIVERSAL::require 
            - added UNIVERSAL::require to the 
              dependencies list
    
    * Moose::Object
        - BUILDALL and DEMOLISHALL were broken 
          because of a mis-named hash key, Whoops :)
