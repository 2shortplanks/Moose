Moose::Cookbook - How to cook a Moose

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Moose cookbook is a series of recipes taken from the Moose 
test suite. Each recipe presents some code, which demonstrates 
some of the features of Moose, and then proceeds to explain the 
details of the code. 

We also provide a L<Moose::Cookbook::FAQ> and a L<Moose::Cookbook::WTF>
for common questions and problems people have with Moose. 

=head1 RECIPES

=head2 Basic Moose

=over 4

=item L<Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe1> - The (always classic) B<Point> example

A simple Moose-based class. Demonstrated Moose attributes and subclassing.

=item L<Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe2> - A simple B<BankAccount> example

A slightly more complex Moose class. Demonstrates using a method
modifier in a subclass.

=item L<Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe3> - A lazy B<BinaryTree> example

Demonstrates several attribute features, including types, weak
references, predicates ("does this object have a foo?"), defaults, and
lazy attribute uction.

=item L<Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe4> - Subtypes, and modeling a simple B<Company> class hierarchy

Introduces the creation and use of custom types, a C<BUILD> method,
and the use of C<override> in a subclass.

=item L<Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe5> - More subtypes, coercion in a B<Request> class

More type examples, including the use of type coercions.

=item L<Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe6> - The augment/inner example

Demonstrates the use of C<augment> method modifiers, a way of turning
the usual method overriding style "inside-out".

=item L<Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe7> - Making Moose fast with immutable

Making a class immutable greatly increases the speed of accessors and
object construction.

=item L<Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe8> - Managing complex relations with trigger (TODO)

I<abstract goes here>

Work off of this http://code2.0beta.co.uk/moose/svn/Moose/trunk/t/200_examples/007_Child_Parent_attr_inherit.t

=item L<Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe9> - Builder methods and lazy_build

The builder feature provides an inheritable and role-composable way to
provide a default attribute value.

=item L<Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe10> - Operator overloading, subtypes, and coercion

Demonstrates using operator overloading, coercion, and subtypes to
model how eye color is determined during reproduction.

=head2 Moose Roles

=over 4

=item L<Moose::Cookbook::Role::Recipe1> - The Moose::Role example

Demonstrates roles, which are also sometimes known as traits or
mix-ins. Roles provide a method of code re-use which is orthogonal to
subclassing.

=item L<Moose::Cookbook::Role::Recipe2> - Advanced Role Composition - method exclusion and aliasing

Sometimes you just want to include part of a role in your
class. Sometimes you want the whole role but one if its methods
conflicts with one in your class. With method exclusion and aliasing,
you can work around these problems.

=item L<Moose::Cookbook::Role::Recipe3> - Runtime Role Composition (TODO)

=head2 Meta Moose

=over 4

=item L<Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe1> - Welcome to the meta-world (Why Go Meta?)

I<abstract goes here>

=item L<Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe2> - A meta-attribute, attributes with labels

One way to extend Moose is to provide your own attribute
metaclasses. Attribute metaclasses let you extend attribute
declarations (with C<has>) and behavior to provide additional
attribute functionality.

=item L<Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe3> - Labels implemented via attribute traits

Extending Moose's attribute metaclass is a great way to add
functionality. However, attributes can only have one metaclass.
Applying roles to the attribute metaclass lets you provide
composable attribute functionality.

=item L<Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe4> - The meta-instance example (TODO)

=item L<Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe5> - The meta-class example (TODO)
