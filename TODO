- make way to iterate over all Moose classes

- roles

Need to figure out the details of composite roles

- type unions

Add support for doing it with Classes which do not have 
a type constraint yet created

- type intersections

Mostly just for Roles

- inherited slot specs

[10:49] stevan	does can be added to,.. but not changed

- triggers

[18:18] mst	what I'd really like is just to say trigger => 'some_method'

- attribute delgates

- proxy attributes

[15:49] 	stevan	you want a proxied attribute
[15:49] 	stevan	which looks like an attribute, 
                    talks like an attribute, smells 
                    like an attribute,.. but if you 
                    look behind the curtain,.. its 
                    over there.. in that other object
  
- moosedoc

We certainly have enough meta-information to make pretty complete POD docs.

- compile time extends

[00:39] 	sri	    but maybe a better syntax for compile time extends
[00:39] 	stevan	I have been pondering that actually
[00:39] 	sri	    use Moose extends => Foo::Bar
[00:40] 	stevan	I think now that we have the Sub::Exporter stuff 
                    in, that kinda thing should be pretty easy

- default should dclone()

TO PONDER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Moose "strict" mode

use Moose 'strict'; This would allow us to have all sort of expensive tests
which can be turned off in prod.

To explain Moose from a very high level
